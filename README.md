# Bard

  Bard is a minimalist, text-only audiobook player designed for the Light Phone III. It brings local audiobooks,
  optional Libby loans, and optional RSS audiobooks into one calm Books screen and one consistent player
  interface.

  Bard is currently private alpha software. The current application version is 0.1.0-alpha3 (versionCode 3).

  ## What Bard Supports

  ### Local audiobooks

  - Single-file MP3 and M4B audiobooks.
  - Files placed directly in Light Phone III/Audiobooks.
  - Embedded title and artist metadata when available, with filename fallback.
  - Manual rescanning from Settings → Local Books.
  - Playback entirely from the file already stored on the phone.

  Local scanning is intentionally limited to the top level of the Audiobooks folder. Bard does not scan
  subfolders or copy local books into app-private storage.

  ### Libby loans

  - Optional connection using Libby's eight-digit Copy To Another Device setup code.
  - Native, text-only shelf and player presentation; the Libby website remains hidden during normal use.
  - Loan progress and due-date metadata when supplied by Libby.
  - Play/pause, ±15 seconds, absolute seeking, and playback speed through Libby's own player controls.
  - Background playback supported by a media-playback foreground service while a Libby book is actively playing.

  Bard keeps one application-scoped WebView for the Libby session and player. It uses document-start JavaScript
  injection, a WebMessage bridge, and Libby's own BIF.objects.spool controls. Bard does not extract protected
  media URLs or replace Libby's playback engine.

  ### RSS audiobooks

  - One RSS item treated as one audiobook.
  - MP3 and M4B audio enclosures.
  - Multiple saved HTTP or HTTPS feeds.
  - Streaming through Android's native media playback APIs.
  - User-initiated full-file downloads for offline playback.
  - Downloaded files stored durably in Bard's app-private storage.
  - Manual feed refresh and removal.

  RSS downloads are never automatic. Removing an RSS download keeps the feed item and listening progress, making
  the book streamable again. Removing a feed removes its books from the library.

  ## Library and Playback

  All enabled sources appear together in one Books screen with no source tabs, cover art, or cards. Books are
  ordered by most recently played; books that have never been played follow alphabetically.

  The same player interface is used for every source and provides:

  - Play and pause.
  - Rewind and forward 15 seconds.
  - A scrubbable progress line.
  - Playback speeds of 1×, 1.25×, 1.5×, 1.75×, and 2×.
  - Persisted position, duration, speed, and last-played ordering.
  - Now Playing restoration after app or phone restart without autoplay.

  The interface is source-independent, but playback is not one single engine: Libby uses its persistent hidden
  WebView player, while local and RSS books use Android's native media player.

  ## Downloads

  The Downloads screen lists only media Bard can accurately identify as stored on the phone:

  - Local MP3/M4B files in the shared Audiobooks folder.
  - Completed Bard-managed RSS downloads.

  Libby loans are deliberately excluded because Bard does not manage or expose Libby's internal offline files.

  Removing a local book from Downloads deletes the original file after Android's confirmation. Removing an RSS
  download deletes only Bard's private downloaded copy and preserves feed metadata, listening progress, speed,
  and ordering.

  ## Getting Started

  ### Local books

  1. Connect the Light Phone III to a computer.
  2. Create an Audiobooks folder at the top level of shared device storage if it does not already exist.
  3. Place single-file .mp3 or .m4b audiobooks directly in that folder.
  4. In Bard, open Settings → Local Books → Scan for Books.

  Android may ask Bard for audio-library permission so it can discover these shared files. Bard does not request
  broad all-files storage access.

  ### Libby

  1. Open Settings → Libby → Connect to Libby.
  2. On another device already connected to Libby, open Menu → Copy To Another Device.
  3. Enter the eight-digit code displayed by Bard.
  4. Bard returns to Books after the Libby session and shelf are ready.

  Bard's native connection flow does not expose passkey recovery or library-card sign-in. Disconnect clears only
  Bard's local Libby WebView session and does not disconnect other devices.

  ### RSS

  1. Open Settings → RSS Feeds → Add Feed.
  2. Enter an HTTP or HTTPS RSS feed URL using the Light-style keyboard.
  3. Open a book to stream it, or use Download in the player to keep it offline.

  Private feed URLs are stored in app-private preferences and are not written to logs. Username/password
  authentication is not supported.

  ## Permissions and Notifications

  Bard's installed APK uses:

  - Internet and network-state access for Libby and RSS.
  - Audio-library read access for the fixed shared Audiobooks folder.
  - Media-playback foreground-service access for reliable Libby screen-off playback.
  - Vibration support supplied by the embedded Light keyboard component.

  While Libby audio is actively playing, Android shows a private ongoing Bard notification. The notification
  keeps Bard's hidden WebView process active when the screen is off and is removed when Libby playback pauses or
  stops.

  ## Current Limitations

  - Light Phone III / Android 13 or newer is the current target environment.
  - Local books are one MP3 or M4B file each; multi-file books are unsupported.
  - No chapter navigation or embedded-chapter UI.
  - Bard's UI never displays cover art.
  - RSS expects one supported audio enclosure per item.
  - No authenticated RSS feeds, scheduled refresh, RSS notifications, or automatic downloads.
  - RSS playback is streaming unless the user explicitly downloads the book.
  - Libby requires another device with an authorized Libby session for setup.
  - Libby integration depends on Libby's web application and may require maintenance when that application
    changes.

  - No ebook reading, cloud sync, metadata editing, or podcast-specific episode features.

  ## Architecture

  Bard is a single-module Kotlin Android application built with Jetpack Compose. The current implementation is
  intentionally incremental:

  - Source-neutral Audiobook and progress records feed the unified library.
  - LocalBookRepository discovers fixed-folder local media.
  - RssFeedRepository persists, fetches, securely parses, and caches RSS feeds.
  - RssDownloadManager owns durable RSS offline files and download state.
  - LocalPlaybackController handles local files and RSS streams/downloads.
  - LibbyWebPlayer owns the persistent application-scoped WebView.
  - LibbyBridge translates source-neutral player actions to Libby's player.
  - AudiobookProgressStore persists playback state, last-active identity, and recent-first ordering across
    sources.

  The UI is built from Bard's Light-style Compose primitives and selected Light SDK-derived resources. It uses
  the Light LP3 keyboard component for RSS URL entry.

  ## Development

  Requirements:

  - JDK 17.
  - Android SDK with API 36 available.
  - Android device or emulator running API 33 or newer.

  Build the debug APK:

  ./gradlew assembleDebug

  The output is:

  app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

  Private release signing, verification, installation, and rollback instructions are documented in RELEASE.md
  (RELEASE.md). Signing keys and keystore.properties must remain outside Git.

  ## Privacy and Security

  Bard does not log setup codes, cookies, authentication tokens, signed media URLs, private RSS URLs, local file
  paths, raw browser storage, or raw Libby bridge payloads. WebView debugging is enabled only in debuggable
  builds.

  RSS XML parsing rejects document declarations and does not execute feed HTML or JavaScript. RSS downloads are
  stored in Bard's private files directory. Android backup is disabled for the application.

  ## Important
